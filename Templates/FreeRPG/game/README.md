### FreeRPG Project ###

The FreeRPG Project is an idea to create a totally open-source and free RPG from assets to game engine, FreeRPG uses the Torque3D MIT engine. The project has only just started and it is literally just stock Torque3D at the moment with some open-source assets available but the plan is to create a base RPG which users can then either "mod" or use to create their own FreeRPG.

#### Notes ####

* I advise using SSH to clone the repo as opposed to HTTPS due to its size, this requires having an SSH key generated on your system, please see [this link for more information.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
* When compiling the engine from source it is possible to use the Project Manager/CMAKE to generate your FreeRPG project if you wish, the instructions listed at the [FreeRPG-Torque3D](https://gitlab.com/FreeRPG/FreeRPG-Torque3D#compile-from-source) repo are only a very basic set, more information can be found at the [Torque3D Wiki](http://torque3d.wikidot.com/).
* I will provide only 32-bit binaries in the [FreeRPG](https://gitlab.com/FreeRPG/FreeRPG) release repo for windows until the linux/64-bit support is more stable but you are welcome to try them for yourself using the [FreeRPG-Torque3D](https://gitlab.com/FreeRPG/FreeRPG-Torque3D) engine repo and the instructions available at the [Torque3D Wiki](http://torque3d.wikidot.com/).

#### How do I get set up? ####

If you simply want to play FreeRPG then all you need to do is clone this repo with the command below:

```git clone git@gitlab.com:FreeRPG/FreeRPG.git```

You should now have a ```FreeRPG.exe``` file in your newly cloned repo folder which you can use to run the FreeRPG Project.

If you would like to compile the engine/game from source to either contribute or to create your own RPG then head over to the [FreeRPG-Torque3D](https://gitlab.com/FreeRPG/FreeRPG-Torque3D) repo and follow the instructions provided.

#### Contribution ####
Please note that FreeRPG is still in the very early stages of development, DO NOT expect much, nothing is finished (or started in most cases) and if you would like to help contribute to the FreeRPG Project then please use the [Contact Form](http://freerpgproject.wordpress.com/contact) available at the website. If you prefer to get your hands dirty then fork the [FreeRPG-Torque3D](https://gitlab.com/FreeRPG/FreeRPG-Torque3D) repo and create your own branch for your development work, then make a pull request when ready.
