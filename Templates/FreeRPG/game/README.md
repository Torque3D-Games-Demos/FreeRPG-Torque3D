### FreeRPG Project ###

The FreeRPG Project is an idea to create a totally open-source and free RPG from assets to game engine, FreeRPG uses the Torque3D MIT engine. The project has only just started and it is literally just stock Torque3D at the moment with some open-source assets available but the plan is to create a base RPG which users can then either "mod" or use to create their own FreeRPG.

### How do I get set up? ###

If you simply want to play FreeRPG or even use it as a base for your own RPG then first you need to clone this repo with the command below:

```git clone git@gitlab.com:hreikin/FreeRPG-Project.git```

Then navigate to the ```FreeRPG-Project/My Projects/FreeRPG``` folder and run the file that is named ```generateProjects.bat```. 

After that has finished navigate to the ```FreeRPG-Project/My Projects/FreeRPG/buildFiles/VisualStudio 2012``` folder then open the file named ```FreeRPG.sln``` and build your project in Visual Studio.
 
You should now have a ```FreeRPG.exe``` file in your ```FreeRPG-Project/My Projects/FreeRPG/game``` folder which you can use to run the FreeRPG Project.

If you would like to use FreeRPG to create your own RPG from scratch then check the [FreeRPG Wiki](https://gitlab.com/hreikin/FreeRPG-Project/wikis/home) for guides on how to compile the engine in either Windows or Linux.
